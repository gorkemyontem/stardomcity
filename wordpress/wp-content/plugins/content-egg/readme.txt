You have to go on youtube, find videos, then on google images, flickr, amazon, twitter, google news, etc. Searching relevant additional content, formatting, adding to post takes too much time for each article. 

And what about monetization? There are tons of affiliate systems with great partnership programs. All of them have it's own good and bad sides. But, what if you want to add products from several affiliate systems? Or, for example, you want to have comparison price list with auto updated prices and products.

Good news, we solved this problem for our projects and we want to offer you the best, all in one instrument for adding additional content from open sources to your posts and best affiliate offers from different affiliate systems to make moneymaking process as easy as possible.
